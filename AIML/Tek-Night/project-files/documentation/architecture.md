# SRCNN

SRCNN (super resolution cnn) is a classic CNN baseline for image upscaling. It uses a convolutional network to learn non-linear features between low-res and high-res images.

### Architecture:

Input LR image (32x32x3)

        | Apply bicubic upscaling

    (128x128x3)


# ESPCN

ESCPN (efficient sub-pixel cnn) is a CNN model used to upscale low-res images to high-res images.

### Why is it better?
- It is much faster than traditional image upscaling methods as it performs all core feature extraction in the LR space, rather than on the expanded HR image.
- The upscaling step is pushed to the very last layer of the network using a sub-pixel convolutional layer. ESPCN rearranges the feature maps into a higher- res grid in one go.
- As the input size is smaller, the network requires small filter sizes to extract features; leading to much lower memory costs and computional complexity.
